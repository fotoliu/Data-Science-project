The paper "Voight-Kampff Testing for Reddit Users" presents a machine learning model designed to differentiate between human and bot accounts on Reddit. Inspired by Philip K. Dickâ€™s Voight-Kampff test from Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?, the authors collected data from recognized bot accounts and human users from AskReddit. The dataset was built using metadata such as account creation date, karma scores, comment activity, and subreddit engagement. Additional behavioral features were derived, including average posting frequency, comment length, and upvote/downvote ratios. The classification model employs a hybrid neural network combining a BERT-based text encoder with a numerical feature processor. The model was trained using an 80/20 train-validation split, achieving 80% validation accuracy, with a slight bias toward bot detection.

For deployment, the model was packaged into a Dockerized FastAPI application, exposing a simple web interface for inputting Reddit usernames and receiving classification results. A multi-threshold decision system was implemented to handle low-activity accounts, reducing false positives. Testing on a separate dataset of known bot accounts showed 100% bot detection accuracy, but some human users with low activity were incorrectly flagged as bots. The authors conclude that further data collection and fine-tuning are needed to improve classification in edge cases.
